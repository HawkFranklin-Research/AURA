# Privacy Policy — AURA (Local AI Research Lab)

**Effective date:** February 1, 2026

AURA is designed for private, on‑device AI. This policy explains how data is handled when you use the app.

## Summary
- **No accounts.** AURA does not require sign‑in.
- **No cloud inference.** Prompts, images, audio, and outputs are processed locally on your device.
- **No data collection by us.** We do not collect, sell, or share your personal data.
- **Offline by design.** Internet is only used to download models or check for updates.

## What we collect
**Nothing.** We do not collect or store your prompts, messages, images, audio, or any personal data on our servers.

## Network usage
AURA uses the internet only for:
- **Model downloads** (from public model hosting such as Hugging Face), and
- **Optional update checks**.

These requests are sent directly from your device to the hosting provider. We do not proxy or store this traffic.

## Permissions
AURA may request device permissions to enable features:
- **Microphone** — for on‑device voice input.
- **Camera / Photos** — for on‑device image input.
- **Storage** — to save model files locally.

All data from these permissions stays on your device and is not uploaded by AURA.

## Third‑party services
AURA does **not** include advertising SDKs or trackers. If you use a build that enables third‑party analytics, it will be disclosed separately. The default build does not send analytics data.

## Children’s privacy
AURA is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## Changes to this policy
If we update this policy, we will revise the effective date above.
