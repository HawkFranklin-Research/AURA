Run open-source AI models locally. Private, offline, and ad-free.

[FULL DESCRIPTION] (4000 chars max)
AURA (Android Utility for Runtime AI) is a professional-grade environment for running open-source Small Language Models (SLMs) locally on your Android device.

Designed by HawkFranklin Research, AURA provides a secure sandbox for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to experiment with on-device AI without relying on cloud servers.

🚀 KEY FEATURES

• Pure Local Intelligence: Powered by models like Gemma 3, Qwen 2.5, DeepSeek R1 Distill, and Phi-4 Mini.
• Privacy First: All inference happens directly on your device. Your prompts and data never leave your phone.
• Offline Capable: Once models are downloaded, no internet connection is required for chat or analysis.
• Research Optimized: Built for prompt engineering, latency testing, and on-device evaluations.
• Completely Ad-Free: A pure tool for science and productivity. No distractions, no tracking.
• Open Source Transparency: Inspect the code, verify privacy claims, and contribute improvements.

⚠️ SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
AURA runs high-performance AI models natively using hardware acceleration.
• RAM: 8GB or higher is strongly recommended. (Devices with 4GB-6GB may experience crashes or slow tokens/sec).
• Processor: Modern Snapdragon 8 Gen 1+ / Tensor G2 or newer recommended for optimal speed.

🧪 COMING SOON (ROADMAP)
We are actively developing advanced features for the next release:
• Chat with PDF & Documents (RAG)
• Real-time Multi-lingual Translation
• Voice-to-Action agents
• Hovering assistant icon (optional overlay)

OPEN SOURCE INITIATIVE
